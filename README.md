## How to set up your own blog using this as a template

*To Do*

1. Fork the Repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the current dependencies
    * Optional: Run `npm run dev` to start a local development server
3. Link to Github. Create a new empty repo (in browser or CLI). Run `git init` to initiate a new project. Add a remote
   connection (whatever URL github gave you)
   . `git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git`.
    * To add all files to the project, run `git add *` and `git add .env`
    * Commit files with `git commit -m '[your message here]`
    * To push files to github, run `git push -u origin master`
4. Sign up for Netlify, link to your github.
5. In netlify options, define:
    * build command: `npm run generate`
    * publish directory: `dist`
6. In Netlify Settings, go to the Identity Tab and click the 'Enable Identity' button.
    * You *should* now be able to sign up / log in with an email. I've had issues with that configuration so I update to
      a Github sign-in. You have to configure that in the 'External Providers' option. You then have to go down to 'Git
      Gateway' services and enable that.
    * Configure Registration - would recommend changing Registration Preferences to 'Invite Only'. You can change that
      once you log in yourself.

If you don't want dark mode, you can remove these lines from the `layouts/default.vue` file head: { htmlAttrs: {
class: 'dark-mode' } },
